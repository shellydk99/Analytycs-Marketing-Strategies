## a) Count total trip all member
```r
SELECT member_casual, rideable_type, COUNT(*) AS total_trips 
	FROM db_cyclistic..trip_2022
GROUP BY member_casual, rideable_type
ORDER BY member_casual, rideable_type;
```
## b) Check Average of ride_length
```r
SELECT AVG(CAST(ride_length AS DECIMAL(10, 2))) AS AverageRideLength
FROM db_cyclistic..trip_2022;
```
## c) Check busiest month
```r
select month, count(month) AS TotalMonth
FROM db_cyclistic..trip_2022
group by month
order by TotalTrips DESC;
```
## d) check busiest weekday
```r
select day_of_week, count(day_of_week) AS TotalTrips
FROM db_cyclistic..trip_2022
group by day_of_week
order by TotalTrips DESC;
```
## e) Check busiest time
```r
SELECT DATEPART(HOUR, started_at) AS HourOfDay, COUNT(*) AS TotalTrips
FROM db_cyclistic..trip_2022
GROUP BY DATEPART(HOUR, started_at)
ORDER BY TotalTrips DESC;
```
## f) Create new table for busiest hours
```r
ALTER TABLE db_cyclistic..trip_2022
ADD BusiestHourOfDay INT;
```
```r
UPDATE db_cyclistic..trip_2022
SET BusiestHourOfDay = DATEPART(HOUR, started_at);
```
